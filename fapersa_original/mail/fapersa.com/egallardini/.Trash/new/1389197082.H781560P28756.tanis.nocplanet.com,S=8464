Dear DraftSight user:

This week, DraftSight is celebrating the milestone of reaching ONE MILLION downloads and its first anniversary.  

Since DraftSight was launched in June 2010, it has been our intent to offer a valuable product and give you the opportunity to provide feedback on its future growth.  We’d like to thank you for the support and consistent response to DraftSight, and we encourage you to continue to share your feedback by sending an email to enhancement@DraftSight.com or by visiting the DraftSight online community. 

To celebrate this milestone, we invite you to visit us at Facebook.com/DraftSight to participate in the DraftSight Trivia Contest that will run weekly through August 15th. A DraftSight trivia question will be delivered each week and the user that responds first with the correct answer will receive a DraftSight gift pack.


Aaron Kelly
Senior Director, DraftSight
